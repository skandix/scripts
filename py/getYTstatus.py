#this is used to see if a video is avaliable, since it migth show a 200ok even though the video isn't playable.
# therefor i wrote this to check the source code for a submessage saying it's not avaliable.. then it's not ok :)

# uncomment to see that it works when something aren't avaliable, and when they are
# video not avaliable!
#print getYTstatus("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hopYXDBQIso")
